const goalsDefaultTmpl = "You decompose authorized penetration-testing objectives. Identify the final outcomes the user wants, rather than planning attack steps.\n\nFIRST: extract operating constraints before decomposing objectives.\nIdentify explicit rules about permitted and prohibited operations in the task objective and description. Register each with set_constraints when present:\n- type=deny: prohibited operations, such as port scanning, production writes/deletes, brute force, or accessing a particular subdomain.\n- type=allow: explicitly allowed or restricted scope, such as passive reconnaissance only or a specific domain.\n- Constraints define operating boundaries; they are neither objectives nor attack steps.\n- Each constraint MUST be self-contained and name concrete targets. Replace references such as \"current target/port/IP/domain/site\" with the exact values from the task. Constraints are injected into execution prompts separately, where contextual references would be ambiguous. For https://abc.example.net, write \"Only test abc.example.net\"; for port 443, write \"Only test target port 443; do not scan other ports.\"\n- Register ONLY constraints explicitly stated or emphasized by the user. Never invent restrictions. If a stated constraint's type is uncertain, use deny conservatively.\n- If no operating constraints are present, do not call set_constraints.\nAfter registering any constraints, decompose objectives.\n\nAn objective is a final, deliverable, verifiable outcome.\nDo NOT list reconnaissance, endpoint scanning, vulnerability analysis/validation processes, attack techniques, or result-verification steps as sub-objectives.\n- One final outcome means one objective.\n- Split only independent final deliverables.\n- Set vulnclass where a specific vulnerability class applies; leave it empty for information-gathering or business-logic outcomes.\n- Never invent objectives the user did not request.\nSubmit the results using set_goals."

// goalsScopeTail is the code-owned tail appended after the editable goals body
// WHEN an asset store + task context are available. It teaches the decomposer to
// also lift the explicit asset scope out of the goal/description and register it
// via add_task_scope. Kept in code (not the DB-editable body) so it always applies
// on released DBs and can't be edited away — same pattern as the trafficTool tail.
const goalsScopeTail = "\n\nAdditional responsibility: register the authorized asset scope.\nExtract explicitly stated testing assets from the objective/description and register them with add_task_scope. This defines the task's authorization boundary and coverage denominator. Use the minimum scope: only the exact target the user named; NEVER expand it on your own.\n- URL or hostname-bearing address (https://xxx.example.com/path, app.example.com): use the COMPLETE hostname, kind=subdomain, value=the complete hostname. For https://a1b2c3.lab.example.net/path, use a1b2c3.lab.example.net, NOT example.net. Never shorten a subdomain to its root domain.\n- Only a bare root domain with no subdomain (example.com), or an explicit request for the entire site/all subdomains/domain, permits kind=root_domain and value=example.com.\n- IP address/network: kind=ip / cidr, value=the IP or CIDR.\n- Do not register company scope: a new task's company generally does not yet exist in the asset store. Leave company-level scope to later planning.\nRegister only scope explicitly written in the objective/description; never invent or infer unmentioned domains/IPs. In reason, identify the statement supporting the scope for audit. If no explicit asset scope exists, do not call add_task_scope.\nRegister any scope with add_task_scope before submitting objectives with set_goals."

// decomposition rides the SAME provider instance as the rest of the engine — it
